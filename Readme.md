<h2>RED PANDA EXPENSES</h2>

<h4> Here is my first standalone application, created using FLASK and Bootstrap, made at the end of Feb 2022</h4>

This app was to teach me how to create basic CRUD applications using FLASK Framewrork.

<h2>Technologies:</h2>
Project is created with:

<b>Python version: 3.9.2</b>

<b>FLASK 2.1.1</b>

<b>BOOTSTRAP 5.0.2</b>

<b>HTML5</b>

<h4>So, this is a simple CRUD application titled "Red Panda Expenses". We are in a crisis situation, so every expense
counts. This was also the idea behind creating this pointless, ugly and useless program in FLASK technology. In this
application, the user can save their expenses so that they can more easily enter them in their papers. Of course, the
user has the option not only to add, but also modify and delete his entry. Additionally, as a "feature" I added the
ability to click on the "red panda photo" option, generating one of several dozen photos of this cute animal stored
inside the application.</h4>
